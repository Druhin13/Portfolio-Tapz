	<h4><b>My Role</b></h4>
	<h5>UI Developer</h5>
	<h5 class="h5other">Designing the Mobile web app, creating prototypes, and developing it in markup code, using html and css</h5>

	<h4><b>Description</b></h4>
	<h5>Hey,<br>
		Not enough Storage ?<br>
		Can't store all the needed apps in your smartphone ?<br>
		Donâ€™t you hate that moment, when you need to clear your storage, just to install one single small app ?
	</h5>
	<h5>If YES...<br>
		Then this app is just for you !<br>
		Now you can get all your favourite apps, just one click away, in 1 single app.
	</h5>
	<h5>Presenting Tapz - The All in One App, here to solve all your storage problems at once.</h5>
	<h5>But how is it doing it ?<br>
		Tapz is itself a webapp, and it also uses the webapps, and thereby takes less space, and you can almost save 70% of your Smartphone Storage Capacity using Tapz.</h5>

	<h4><b>Design Thinking</b></h4>

	<h5>The main objective of the app is to solve the storage problems of the users. And to solve that problem, Tapz runs different webapps in it, and there by reduces the data usage and the storage usage by almost 70%

	</h5>
	<h5>The goal was to bring in as much as users as possible. And to make that happen, the app had to be user-friendly.
	</h5>
	<h5>And so, a simple-colorful, user interface was created, which can be easily understood by anyone.</h5>

	<h5>Colorful WebApp icons were used to attract the users, and were also made bigger </h5>

	<h4><b>Games Page</b></h4>

	<h5>Games Page was introduced to increase the engagement with the users. Right now the Tapz has 30 games. And all of them are just one tap away to play, without even downloading them.</h5>


	<h4><b>Apps Page</b></h4>

	<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Druhin13/Portfolio-Tapz/master/assets/img4.png" target="_blank"><img class="hero-img" loading="lazy" src="assets/img4.png"></a>

	<h5>Apps Page was contains different sections like Social apps, shopping apps, video streaming apps, etc. All the apps are available without even downloading them. New app gets added everyday to the Tapz App Page.<br><br>And to improve the app, and increase the interaction, users are asked to send a request for their favourite app, which is not yet available in Tapz.</h5>
